# Contributing

## Mandatory rules

- **No direct pushes to `main`**.
- Create a branch, open a Pull Request, and get review from the repo owner (takeshi miura) before merging.

Recommended branch naming:
- `feature/<topic>`
- `fix/<topic>`
- `chore/<topic>`

## Development

```bash
npm install --include=dev
npm run dev
```

## Release / deploy

- Prefer merging via GitHub UI after review.
- Keep secrets out of the repository.
